This is a lisp-ish calculator I made on the trainride home today.
I hope to turn it into a fully-fledge lisp interpreter at some point soon (and then maybe I'll learn how to program in lisp afterwards).
This was written with the help of Peter Norvig's article titled "[How to Write a Lisp Interpreter In Python](http://norvig.com/lispy.html)."
